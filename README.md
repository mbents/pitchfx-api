# pitchfx-api
This is a web app built using ASP.NET MVC WebAPI. It performs a correlation using two sets of data selected by the user. It will also run a simple linear regression, display the two sets of data on a chart, and fit a line through the points. You will need to change the password in the web.config connection string to match your database user's password.

PitchF/X data can be downloaded, parsed, and imported using this project:
